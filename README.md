## Notes

For state management I'm using the beta Recoil library from Facebook.
There's a console error when running the app locally that's caused by a Recoil bug, as documented here: https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/issues/12

## Todos

- update app with fix for Recoil bug when it's available
